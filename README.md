# PyArena

A Python version of Arena: https://github.com/danielrcollins1/Arena

Main differences:
- Uses D&D 5th edition rules
- Only Men vs Men combat
- Only Fighters class, Champion subclass.
- Written in Python
- CSV files are in Daniel's repo.
- No console print.
- Saves data in a PostgreSQL database.

Interesting findings:
- Most fighters stays at the first 4 levels.
- Very few pass the 4th level barrier but when they do they go up to 10th level.
