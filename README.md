# PyArena

A Python version of Arena: https://github.com/danielrcollins1/Arena

Main differences:
- Uses D&D 5th edition rules
- Only Men vs Men combat
- Only Fighters class, Champion subclass.
- Written in Python
- CSV files are in Daniel's repo.
- No console print.
- ~~Saves data in a PostgreSQL database~~.
- Saves data in a log file.
- A script to load the log file into the database will come Soonâ„¢.

Interesting findings:
- When fighting another fighters, most fighters at or below the 4th level.
- Very few pass the 4th level barrier but when they do they can go up to 10th level.
